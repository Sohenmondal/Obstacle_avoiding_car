# Obstacle_avoiding_car

##Obstacle Avoiding Robotic Car System

Overview
This project involves a robotic car system designed to prevent accidents by detecting obstacles and automatically stopping the car.

##Key Features

Obstacle Detection: Sensors detect obstacles in the car's path.

Automatic Stopping: The car stops when an obstacle is detected to avoid collisions.

Real-Time Processing: Instantaneous decision-making to ensure safety.

##Setup

Prerequisites: Hardware (robotic car, sensors) and software (control algorithms).
Connect Sensors: Install and connect obstacle detection sensors.
Program Car: Upload the control software to the robotic car's system.
Test: Run the system to ensure proper obstacle detection and stopping functionality
